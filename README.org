#+title: LaTeX Template
Welcome to my personal template! To use the full potential of this awesome template, you'll need to know some things:
- This template uses variables to keep some information constant throughout the file. These can be located at the "variables" section
- A title page is also available using all of these variables
- You can change the babel language using the following command before the preamble: ~\PassOptionsToPackage{YOUR_LANGUAGE}{babel}~. If not, it'll default to English

** Languages
This template in its current state supports the following languages for some misc things (theorem title, exercise title, etc):
- Spanish
- English

** Variables
This template uses some variables to make some information consistent throughout the file:

| *doctitle*          | Document title (/ex. Template/)
| *doctype*           | Document type (/ex. Notes, Documentation, etc/)
| *headerauthor*      | Abreviated author names, this will be displayed in the header of every page
| *authorname*        | Author name (/ex. Zygmut/). If your document has more than one author this variable should include your names separated by // 
| *authorcontact*     | Author contact information. I tend to put my email and some legal identification document (/ex. NIF, Passport/)
| *institution*       | Name of your institution (/ex. Massachusetts Institute of Technology/)
| *institutionImage*  | Used only in the titlepage. Defined as the path to your institution image (/ex. img/MIT.png/). If you dislike this feature use \def\institutionImage{}
| *group*             | Group number. Some institutions divide classes on various groups, so you can use this to display your group (/ex. Group 01/)

** Custom commands
This template comes with some custom commands I regularly use
| *rom*           | Given some number, prints it's roman representation (/ex. \rom{5} -> V/)
| *ccbox*         | Given a color and it's box content, creates a box with that color as background (/ex. \ccbox{red}{hello}/)
| *cbox*          | Given it's box content, creates a box with a white background and that content (/ex. \cbox{hello}/)

** Custom enviroments
Enviroments use the /\begin{} \end{}/ syntax. These are some custom ones that I use
| *code*       | Given the font size and the programming language, prints the code with some code highlighting (/ex. \begin{code}{\scriptsize}{python} ... \end{code}/)
| *definition* | Theorem enviroment that formats it's contents to a green box 
| *example*    | Theorem enviroment that formats it's contents to a blue box 
| *exercise*   | Theorem enviroment that puts it's contents between two red lines. It whould be noted that the solution to this exercise has another enviroment. Furthermore, I usually use square brackets argument to post a link to the solution i.e \begin{exercise}[Solution\ref{sol:this_exercise}] ... \end{exercise}
| *solution*   | Theorem enviroment that puts it's contents with a red label. It whould be noted that the exercise to this solution has another enviroment. Furthermore, I usually use square brackets argument to post a link to the exercise i.e \begin{solution}[Exercise\ref{ex:this_solution}] ... \end{solution}
